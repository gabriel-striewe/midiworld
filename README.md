midiworld

This software wants to be a connection between closed source pro audio worlds (cubase, protools, sibelius...) and open source linux pro audio software (rosegarden, jack...), circumventing the prevalent driver troubles with linux regarding pro audio hardware. 

Basically it will also be an open source midi operating system to be used on
open hardware synths.
