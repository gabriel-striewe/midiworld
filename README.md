In the pro audio world, closed source software isn't necessarily evil. But does closed source software interoperate with open source software?

This software will eventually provide a connection between the world of closed source pro audio sofware (cubase, protools, sibelius) and open source pro audio software often used on the GNU/Linux operating system. 

The open source world offers a
universe of interesting software. By providing a bridge between the established closed sourced world and the more experimental open source side using midi, we will be able to use open source software without leaving the realms of our established and tested closed source environments.
