=========

used on all sorts of open hardware audio equipment. It will be the base of a
series of open hardware synth projects and allow this open hardware equipment to
be used in connection with midi, either software or hardware.

It will eventually also provide a connection between the world of closed source
pro audio sofware (cubase, protools, sibelius) and open source pro audio
software often used on the GNU/Linux operating system. In spite of the prevalent
driver troubles plaguing the adoption of Linux as a professional operating
system for professional audio work, the whole open source environment offers a
universe of interesting software. By providing a bridge between the established
closed sourced world and the more experimental open source side using midi, we
will be able to use open source software without leaving the realms of our
established and tested closed source environments. 

By this it will also be possible to use computer hardware, which by itself
wouldn't be suited to be used as pro audio hardware, to outsource computing
power.
